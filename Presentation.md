Using data from Winchell et al. 2016, we investigate the effects of urbanization in Anolis cristatellus, the crested anole.

We first take a look at the abiotic aspects of urban vs natural habitats (substrate types, thermal aspects) and conducted a PCA on some of these abiotic characters. We find that urban habitats are hotter than natural habitats, and contain man-made substrates such as metal and concrete that are absent in natural areas

We then look at the morphometric responses that may be under selection in urban environments. We conducted a second PCA on morphometric responses, and then compare single limb traits (log-transformed) using Ancova (as per Winchell et al. 2016) and boxplots for visualization

Lastly, we take a look at future possibilities for analysis. Our main goal is to perform a multivariate response analysis, using the 6 aforementioned limb responses with urbanization/natural context as a categorical predictor variable. We also note aspects of the environment that we wished we had data on, such as canopy cover. 

Thanks!

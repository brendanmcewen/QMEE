Using my anole dataset, we could first investigate whether there appears to be a hot-spot effect (increased temperatures in urban areas) present at any or all of the three sites used in the study. This would probably be achievable with a model that investigates the effect of context on temperature at each site, while controlling for the time of day. If there’s an effect, we could see if there’s a difference in body temperatures in the lizards caught (i.e. lizards themselves in urban contexts are at hotter thermal state). If there is a hotspot effect but the lizards themselves are NOT warmer, then that might suggest that they engage in thermoregulatory behavior that keeps them at a more suitable thermal state. This is pretty basic, almost all ectotherms thermoregulate to maintain an optimum thermal state, but might be cool to quantify for ourselves.


Then the second half of this that we could look at is the whole femur length thing: Do lizards in novel, urbanized habitats have longer limbs relative to their body? Perhaps this new environment with more uniform surfaces (pavement, flat green space e.g. parks) favors longer limbs that enable higher sprint speeds.
